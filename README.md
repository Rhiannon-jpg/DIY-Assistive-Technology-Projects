# DIY-Assistive-Technology-Projects
Exploring and creating DIY assistive technology devices and tools.

## Background
While working at Hello Maker Studio, I was introduced to assistive technology and, with help from peers, designed my first AT device for a speech pathologist who needed an adaptive switch interface for a patient with fine motor difficulties.

## About This Repository
This repo will document and share the AT devices I am experimenting with or developing. I hope to add more projects over time.
