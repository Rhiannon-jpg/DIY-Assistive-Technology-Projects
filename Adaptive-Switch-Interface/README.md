## Adaptive Switch Interface
This project is a DIY adaptive switch interface designed for users with fine motor difficulties.
The device uses two TRRS jacks to connect standard assistive-technology switches to a microcontroller, 
allowing it to function as a Human Interface Device (HID) for computers, tablets, or other electronics.

This folder contains all CAD files, code, and documentation needed to build the device.

## Build Instructions

## Acknowledgements
This was my first time designing a CAD model and creating an electronic device. I received valuable guidance from peers, particularly in selecting the electronic boards needed for the project. Specific contributions have been documented in the subfolders.
