## Adaptive Switch Interface
This project is a DIY adaptive switch interface designed for users with fine motor difficulties.
The device uses two TRRS jacks to connect standard assistive-technology switches to a microcontroller, 
allowing it to function as a Human Interface Device (HID) for computers, tablets, or other electronics.

This fodler contains all CAD files, code, and documentation needed to build the device.
